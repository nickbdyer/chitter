Write a Twitter clone, allowing users to post to a public stream.

Requirements

Plan
----

Given the size of this project, I intend to approach it in small steps lead by cucumber tests on the user interface. Although similar to the bookmark manager project, since that project was not UI lead, I think this will be benefical to my learning.
